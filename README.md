# Text-Based Transaction Categorization

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for automatically categorizing text descriptions into predefined spending categories. The system is designed to classify input text (e.g., transaction memos from bank statements) into one of six categories, enabling automated financial tracking and analysis.

## Categories
The model predicts one of the following categories:

- **Food**: Expenses related to groceries, restaurants, cafes, etc.  
- **Transportation**: Costs for fuel, public transit, ride-sharing, tolls, etc.  
- **Household**: Expenses for home maintenance, rent, mortgage, utilities, furniture, etc.  
- **Subscription**: Recurring payments for services (streaming, software, memberships).  
- **Investment**: Transactions related to stocks, bonds, retirement contributions, etc.  
- **Other**: A catch-all category for transactions that do not fit the above classes or fall below a specific count threshold in the training data.

## Model Performance
A comprehensive comparison of several classical and modern NLP modeling approaches was conducted. Notably, all tested models achieved remarkably similar and high performance on the held-out test set.

### Evaluated Models
- Logistic Regression (on TF-IDF features)  
- Na√Øve Bayes (on TF-IDF features)  
- Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM on TF-IDF features)  
- Random Forest (on TF-IDF features)  
- Sentence Transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) + Logistic Regression Classifier  

### Results
All models demonstrated strong classification capabilities, achieving accuracy scores consistently between **91% and 92%**.

## Key Technical Details
- **Task**: Multi-class Text Classification  
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: The *Other* category was created to group low-frequency labels, improving model stability and generalization.  
- **Text Representation**:  
  - **Classical Models**: Utilize TF-IDF for vectorization.  
  - **Advanced Model**: Uses dense text embeddings generated by a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model, which captures deeper semantic meaning before classification.
